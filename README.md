# Ian Wang Practice Repo

This is a practice repo to teach me the basics of creating repos on GitHub for the purpose of my STAT184 class.
The current plan is to create a README and then commit the README.md file to my dev branch.

## Data

## Current Plan
1. Make a repo
2. Make a commit with a good subject/message
3. Use branches
4. Set up an initial README.md file
5. Use issues feature

## Repo Organization
This repo will use a simple organizational structure. All files will be found in the top level and without any sub-folders.
